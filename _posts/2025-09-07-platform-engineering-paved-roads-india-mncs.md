title: Platform Engineering for MNCs in India — Paved Roads, Golden Paths & Cost‑to‑Serve
description: A practical blueprint to cut MTTR, slash onboarding time, and reduce cost/feature with an Internal Developer Platform.
---

> **TL;DR:** Ship value faster by standardizing developer **golden paths** on an Internal Developer Platform (IDP). Start with three paths (API, data, frontend), measure *time to first deploy*, and track **MTTR** and **cost/feature**. This post lays out a reference architecture, adoption playbook, and a 6‑week bootstrap.

## Why IDP now
- Talent leverage from India: onboard new hires in days, not weeks.  
- Compliance and reliability: consistent guardrails with paved roads.  
- Cost visibility: **cost‑to‑serve** per feature, not vague cloud bills.

## Minimum Viable Platform (6 capabilities)
1. **CI** (build, test)  
2. **CD** (progressive delivery, approvals)  
3. **IaC** (standard stacks, secure by default)  
4. **Runtime** (Kubernetes/serverless with templates)  
5. **Observability** (logs, metrics, traces, SLOs)  
6. **Developer Portal** (Backstage-like catalog)

## Golden Paths (start with three)
- **API service**: repo scaffold → tests → deploy to staging → promote.  
- **Data pipeline**: ingestion template → quality checks → lineage → publish.  
- **Frontend**: component library → preview env → a11y checks → release.

**Metric to watch:** **Time to first deploy** (TTFD). Push for minutes, not days.

## Cost‑to‑Serve & FinOps guardrails
- Tag costs by product/value stream; expose **cost per change**.  
- Default budgets + alerts; show **unit economics** (₹/API call, ₹/order).  
- Weekly review: reliability × cost × adoption.

## Adoption Playbook (make Platform a product)
- Define PQLs: *“team created service”*, *“first deployment”*, *“SLO defined”*.  
- Platform NPS; roadmap shaped by user interviews.  
- Champions in each tribe; office hours; enablement kits.

## 6‑Week Bootstrap (what I run)
- **Week 1–2**: pick critical golden paths, wire CI/CD + IaC + obs, publish starter templates.  
- **Week 3–4**: onboard 2–3 pilot teams; measure TTFD, MTTR; tune docs.  
- **Week 5–6**: expand to 6–8 services; set SLOs; stand up cost lenses.

### Loom (≤5 min) — Script
- **00:00–00:45** — The pain (onboarding, MTTR, inconsistency).  
- **00:45–02:00** — Walk the reference architecture.  
- **02:00–03:30** — Demo a golden path (scaffold → test → deploy → observe).  
- **03:30–04:15** — Cost‑to‑serve lens and weekly scorecard.  
- **04:15–05:00** — The 6‑week bootstrap & next steps.
